# BMP for Scapy

This repo contains a basic implementation of BMP in [Scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy/).

The code was used to generate BMP packets to test the implementation of draft
[draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv/)
in the [pmacct](https://github.com/pmacct/pmacct) collector.
